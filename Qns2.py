# Exercise 2: Simple Sums

# Step 1: Declaring the first number and setting it to 8
num1 = 8

# Step 2: Declaring the second number and setting it to 10
num2 = 10

# Step 3: Adding the two numbers and storing the result in a new variable
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Step 4: Printing the sum to the console with a clear message
print("The sum is:", sum_result)
